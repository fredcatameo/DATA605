        <p class="author">Fred Catameo</p>
        <p class="date">10 min read | published February 10, 2025</p>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Ever wondered why central banks, like the Bank of Canada or the U.S. Federal Reserve, hike or cut policy interest rates? How does an increase or a decrease in these policy interest rates affect us? 
                Can we somehow predict this change? In this data story, various datasets from the Bank of Canada and Statistics Canada will be used to answer all these questions in a data-driven fashion.</p>
            <p>The short answer is this policy interest rate, also called the key interest rate or target overnight rate, is primarily set by the Bank of Canada, as part of its monetary policy, to control and 
                stabilize inflation. It is the key interest rate from which banks can base their interest rates on mortgages, credit cards, and savings deposits.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>To measure inflation, the Bank of Canada recommends using the &ldquo;core inflation&rdquo; instead of the overall total consumer price index (total CPI) because it is less affected by certain 
                volatile CPI components, as well as transient indirect tax changes, such as the recent GST tax holiday (htt1).&nbsp; &nbsp;Essentially, inflation, as defined in Investopedia, is the gradual 
                loss of purchasing power that is reflected in a broad rise in prices for goods and services over time (htt2).&nbsp; &nbsp;For this report, as computed by the Bank of Canada in their projections, 
                core inflation is computed as the average of CPI-trim and CPI-median, two core inflation measures they use (htt3).</p>
            <p>In a previous master research paper, examining the Canadian household financial setting, the positive correlation between mortgage interest rates and CPI percent changes was observed, albeit there 
                is a lag in response for mortgage interest rate.&nbsp; As mentioned earlier, mortgage interest rate is closely tied to the policy interest rate.&nbsp; The line plot of historical CPI percent 
                changes and mortgage interest rates showed that around March 2022, core inflation was quite high, mortgage interest rates also increased.&nbsp; Digging further, one will find that the Bank of 
                Canada did raise the policy interest rate on March 2, 2022, to counter the soaring inflation at the time (htt4).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The Bank of Canada announces interest rate adjustments on eight scheduled Wednesdays yearly (htt5).&nbsp; There was one last December 11, 2024, which, a few days before, the master research paper 
                correctly hinted that the Bank of Canada will lower policy interest rates since it was also observed that the core inflation has already gone down (htt6).&nbsp; On January 29, 2025, Bank of 
                Canada further reduced the policy rate to 3% (htt7).&nbsp; The next scheduled announcement is on March 12, 2025 (htt8).&nbsp; With the latest uncertainty brought on by the looming U.S tariffs 
                on Canadian goods, can it somehow be predicted (using a machine learning model) if this would be a major or minor hike, cut, or a hold?</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h2><strong>How changes in policy interest rate influence inflation</strong></h2>
            <p>A higher policy interest rate essentially makes borrowing money and paying off debt more expensive.&nbsp; It tightens people&rsquo;s pockets having less to spend.&nbsp; It reduces the demand 
                for goods and services.&nbsp; This low demand in turn, decreases inflation by slowing down how fast prices rise (htt9).&nbsp;&nbsp; A good measure of households&rsquo; financial vulnerability 
                to unexpected shocks such as unemployment, illness, or interest rate hikes is the debt-to-income ratio (htt10).&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; debt-to-income ratio = total debt payments / gross household income</p>
            <p>However, what really matters most is the households&rsquo; debt service coverage ratio which measures the ability to pay off or service its existing debt.&nbsp; It is a widely used indicator of 
                a household&rsquo;s financial health.&nbsp; It is computed by dividing the net operating income, which is the revenue minus certain operating expenses or also equal to the earnings before 
                interest and tax (EBIT), over the total debt service, which is the current debt obligations including any interest, principal, etc. due in the coming year.&nbsp; Note that this is directly 
                impacted by changes in policy interest rate. &nbsp;A DSCR of at least 1.20 to 2.00 is typically considered good to strong (htt18).</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; debt service coverage ratio = net operating income / total debt service</p>
            <p>Conversely, a decrease in policy interest rate, reduces the amount needed to pay off debt.&nbsp; This encourages people to borrow money especially for big purchases such as a house or car.&nbsp; 
                It encourages people to spend more and save less.&nbsp; With the increased demand for goods and services, manufacturers are encouraged to build more.&nbsp; In turn, this translates to more jobs 
                or higher total rewards (wages, benefits, commissions, bonuses etc.) for workers.&nbsp; To meet the increased cost due to higher demand, this tends to increase prices, and consequently, inflation 
                (htt11).&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;"><em>One important thing to note is that this economic feedback loop, </em><em>if done right, takes time to take 
                <br>effect, usually about 12 to 18 months (htt13).</em></p>
            <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
            <p>Examining the debt-to-income ratio of Canadian households shows a drastic increase in debt-to-income ratio in 2022 coinciding with the big policy rate increase in March 2022.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The debt service coverage ratio did not drop in March 2022, this is because the increase in debt payments was compensated by increases in household net operating income, thus, keeping it still 
                at financially healthy levels.</p>

            <h2><strong>How policy interest rate is related to GDP</strong></h2>
            <p>Gross domestic product, as defined in Investopedia, is the total monetary or market value of all the finished goods and services produced within a country in a specific time period (htt12).&nbsp; 
                From Economics 101:</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GDP = Consumer spending + Government spending + Investment 
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  + Net exports (Balance of trade)</p>
            <p>We have ascertained earlier that consumer spending is influenced strongly by policy interest rate and inflation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Business investments are also directly affected by policy interest rate 
                hikes because borrowing costs for capital increases.&nbsp; One way to boost economic growth and GDP is by lowering the policy interest rate to stimulate consumer spending, economic activity, 
                and business investments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Consumer spending is typically the biggest component of a country&rsquo;s GDP (htt14).&nbsp;</p>

                </div>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content">
            <p>However, of all the components of GDP, net exports is the most important because when the total value of exports exceed the total value of imports, GDP of a country tends to increase (htt15).&nbsp; 
                The balance of trade impacts GDP the most, thus, this is where the looming U.S. tariffs imposed by Trump on Canadian goods would have the most negative impact.&nbsp; This is exacerbated by the 
                fact that the United States account for huge portion of Canada's exports and imports as of December 2024.  
                Please note that the pie chart values will not add up to the exact total due to rounded figures as mentioned by Statistics Canada.</p>

            <h2><strong>A machine learning model to predict policy interest rate change</strong></h2>
            <p>There is a formula called the Taylor Rule invented by famed economist John Taylor in 1992 which serves as simplistic general rule of thumb for central banks in setting the policy interest rate.&nbsp; 
                It essentially aims to suggest the nominal policy interest rate that will close the gap between the current and the target core inflation and real GDP (htt16).&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;As defined 
                in Investopedia, 
                real GDP is nominal GDP adjusted for inflation (htt17).</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nominal policy interest rate = neutral real policy interest rate 
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; + 0.5*(current inflation rate &ndash; target 
                inflation rate)
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; + 05*(logarithm of real GDP &ndash; logarithm of 
                potential GDP)</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>For example, target inflation rate for Bank of Canada is 2%.&nbsp;&nbsp; The current inflation rate (total CPI) is 1.8%.&nbsp; Assuming a GDP output gap close to zero 
                (economy is growing at a moderate pace), simplifying equation, the Taylor Rule suggests a nominal policy interest rate of 3.7%.&nbsp; The actual current policy interest rate set by the Bank of 
                Canada was 3% 
                this January 29, 2025.&nbsp; The Bank of Canada just uses the Taylor Rule as a baseline guide, but other economic factors are considered.&nbsp; However, this does suggest that inflation and GDP 
                are the two 
                main predictors for the policy interest rate.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Out of curiosity, exploratory attempts were made to build a machine learning model (model #1) using random forest regression to predict the policy interest rate trained on historical core inflation 
                and real GDP data.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
        </div>
    </div>
                <div align="center" class="iframe-container"><iframe class="responsive-iframe" src="./5Model1_RFvsGB.html"></iframe>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>For performance comparison, a second model was built trained on historical core inflation, real GDP, unemployment rate, and CAD forex rate.  Unemployment rate is one of key factors the Bank of 
                Canada considers in setting the policy interest rate.
                The Canadian dollar foreign exchange rate has a great impact on the balance of trade.  Changes in policy interest rates causes indirect fluctuation in currency value.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        </div>
    </div>
                <div align="center" class="iframe-container"><iframe class="responsive-iframe" src="./5Model2_RFvsGB.html"></iframe>

    <div class="container">
        <div class="content"> 
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>A third model was built similar to the second model but employed principal component analysis (PCA) dimensionality reduction. Statistical checks on the dataset failed for linearity, normality, and 
                homoscedasticity which suggests the need to try alternative dimensionality reduction methods in the future, perhaps UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>All in all, comparison of MSE and R-squared between models shows that the best performing model # 2 Gradient Boosting, followed by model # 2 Random Forest.  This is with a Train-Test-Split model validation.
            To further validate the model, Leave-One-Out Cross Validation (suitable for small datasets) will be used.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>In summary, policy interest rate is the Bank of Canada&rsquo;s primary means of regulating inflation and attaining GDP targets. 
                It is through the direct influence of policy interest rate (and its direct influence on interest on debt) on the households&rsquo; and business&rsquo; debt service ratio 
                that it can indirectly stabilize core inflation and stimulate economic GDP growth.  In real-life, the equation to predict the ideal policy interest rate is not as simple as the classic Taylor Rule, 
                since there are other unpredictable, complex, or abstract factors at play such as the weather, a pandemic, unemployment, population growth, U.S tariffs, the foreign exchange rate (foreign investment confidence), 
                etc.</p>
            <p>Policy interest rates influence or regulate consumer spending which is the biggest contributor to GDP.  As a side note, net exports (balance of trade) is affected by the foreign exchange rate 
                which is also indirectly affected by the policy interest rate.  Due to the huge portion of Canada's exports and imports to and from the U.S., Canada is negatively affected by the looming U.S. tariffs.
            </p>
            <p>This is a preliminary attempt on a machine learning model to predict policy interest rate based on key predictors &ndash; core inflation, GDP, unemployment rate, and forex rate.  Ensemble methods, Random Forest
                and Gradient Boosting regressions were used for comparison of R-squared and MSE metrics.  Random Forest regression was also combined with principal component analysis dimensionality reduction 
                to compare model performance.  Further work can be done with hyperparameter tuning of n_estimators and max_depth for the Random Forest models, as well as, cross-validation to check for overfitting.
                One more thing to note is that since time-series data is being dealt with in this case, the stationarity of the data needs to be checked to confirm that it is safe to treat the dataset as 
                purely cross-sectional without any time-related aspects and without overlooking any essential temporal dependencies, trends or seasonality.
                Popular time-series forecasting techniques such as ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) is also worth looking into.
                Definitely, this predictive model will be revisited and refined further in the future.</p>
